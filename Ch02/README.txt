This folder contains two code example:

 - dating.go for the dating match example, to run it, you need copy datingTestSet.txt to this folder.
 - handwritng.go for the handwriting recognition example, to run you copy put trainingDigits and testDigits folder to this folder.

The result might not be same as the python program, but the difference should be very small, and the reason I believe is the difference of the languages.
